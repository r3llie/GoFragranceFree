    <h1>Why Fragrance Free?</h1>
    <p>
      Up to 30% of people report having adverse reactions to a petroleum
      chemical (<a
        href="https://www.seisen.com/student-life/seisen-post/features/~board/seisen-post/post/the-enemy-of-humanity-and-our-earth-petrochemicals"
        target="_blank"
        >petrochemical</a
      >) named "fragrance". Furthermore, people living with Multiple Chemical
      Sensitivity (MCS) report having allergy-like reactions after being exposed
      to very low levels of fragrance found in most everyday products. Up to 72%
      of asthmatics are also affected. Even if you aren't reactive to these
      synthetic chemicals, over time they may accumulate ~potentially increasing
      the rist of developing sensitization. & To make matters worse, these
      chemicals are made to stick onto fabric, hair & skin ~taking multiple
      washes to fully remove!
    </p>
